# Customer-Analysis

In this repo we are conducting customer analysis on borrowers to develop a loaning strategy.
## Case Prompt:

You are thinking about investing some money, but whatever your bank is offering seems boring and not fulfilling. You got interested in a peer to peer (P2P) lending platform http://www.fellowfinance.fi that connects people who want to borrow some money with people who are ready to lend (invest) some. The returns that borrowers are offering there are rather high, but it happens that money is not paid back on time, or sometimes even not paid back at all â€“ borrowers default on their loans.

Imagine that you are about to lend some money there, and you need to decide to whom. You would want to avoid those people who are likely to default. In an offer, you can find the user profile (information about the borrower, such as age, gender, education, etc.), an offered return (or an interest that he or she is ready to pay for borrowing your money), and when he or she is going to return the money. Of course, you cannot say for sure if this or that particular borrower will return the money on time or even at all, it is the risk. The good part is that you have access to the full loan database of the company (see files CreditScoringDataSet.xls and CreditScoringDataSet_description.pdf) and you can do analysis on over 4000 loans and their performance! The data contains user profiles AND loan performance indicators, such as how long the payback was delayed (e.g. InDebt30Day) or whether the loan defaulted (AD). You need to figure out what kind of borrowers you want to invest to, or in other words to identify which borrower characteristics predict good loan performance. It is up to you to decide which return expectation you would like to have and what risk levels you are ready to take (of course, to some reasonable extent, the highest offered returns might happen never to be returned).
